#Experimenting with SASS

Some things I learned building this template

* some SEO friendly HTML5 structures (like headers, asides and stuff)
* sass things like:
* creating my own bootstrap like grid system
* nesting
* templates and a bunch of other stuff

A roadmap

* make header and footer responsive
* design everything (i.e make it look pretty)
* break things in partials via Dust.js

If this project caught your eye than let me know. I'll try and keep this updated as I learn new stuff.


NOTE: for some weird reason (I accidentally made a repo in a subfolder or something) if you want to try this
in your machine you'll need to rename the "sassy" folder to "sass".
Also don't forget to `npm install` all the dependencies.
