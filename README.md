#Experimenting with SASS

Some things I learned building this template

* some SEO friendly HTML5 structures (like headers, asides and stuff)
* sass things like:
* creating my own bootstrap like grid system
* nesting
* templates and a bunch of other stuff

A roadmap

* make header and footer responsive
* design everything (i.e make it look pretty)
* break things in partials via Dust.js

If this project caught your eye than let me know. I'll try and keep this updated as I learn new stuff.
